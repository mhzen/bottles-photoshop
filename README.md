Bottles configuration and guide for using Photoshop CC (2024) on linux

# Compatibility

- Photoshop CC 2024 (works fine but no gpu acceleration)

# Requirements

- Bottles (duh)
- Windows on a vm or a computer (only for installing part)

# How to use

1. Import the bottle configuration into bottles
2. Follow [MattKC's guide](https://forum.mattkc.com/viewtopic.php?t=336) from steps one to four. The wineprefix here is instead your bottle drive_c folder (you can access that by clicking the three dot on the top right and select browse files)
3. Copy `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Adobe Photoshop 2024.ink` to the bottle aswell
4. Restart bottles, and you'll see Photoshop on the Bottles programs list now
5. To make photoshop appear in your app list, click the three dot beside photoshop and click Add Desktop Entry.
6. Start using photoshop on linux!!.

i will improve this guide later, especially step 2, and make the whole process easier, but for now this'll do :P
